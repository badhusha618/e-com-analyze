To create a JWT (JSON Web Token) login in your React application using Replit AI, you can provide the following detailed prompt. This prompt draws on best practices for React project setup, JWT authentication, and effective AI prompting to guide Replit AI in generating a coherent and structured solution.
Here's a comprehensive prompt for Replit AI:
"Goal: Implement a robust JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication system for a React single-page application.
Frontend Technology Stack:
• React: For building the user interface.
• Vite: To scaffold and manage the React project due to its faster development cycles and optimized builds.
• react-router-dom: For handling client-side routing and defining protected routes.
• axios: For making HTTP requests to interact with a (mock) backend API.
Key Features to Implement (Procedural Thinking): Please provide a step-by-step plan, followed by the code implementation for each step.
1. Project Setup:
    ◦ Start by setting up a new React project using Vite.
    ◦ Install necessary dependencies: react-router-dom and axios.
2. Authentication Context (AuthContext and AuthProvider):
    ◦ Create a dedicated context using React.createContext() to manage the authentication state (e.g., the JWT token) globally across the application.
    ◦ Develop an AuthProvider component that encapsulates the authentication logic. This provider should:
        ▪ Store the JWT token (initially, you can use localStorage for simplicity, but please also include a comment or note about the security implications of storing sensitive tokens in localStorage regarding XSS attacks, and suggest more secure alternatives like HttpOnly cookies, as discussed in the sources).
        ▪ Provide functions to setToken (for login) and clearToken (for logout).
        ▪ Configure axios defaults to include the JWT as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for all subsequent requests when the token is present.
    ◦ Create a custom hook, useAuth, to easily access the authentication context from any component.
3. Login Page:
    ◦ Design a simple Login component with input fields for credentials (e.g., username/password) and a submit button.
    ◦ Simulate a login API call using axios, where a mock JWT token is received upon successful authentication.
    ◦ Upon receiving the token, use the setToken function from AuthContext to update the authentication state and redirect the user to a protected area.
4. Protected Routes (ProtectedRoute Component):
    ◦ Create a ProtectedRoute component that checks the authentication status (i.e., if a token exists in the AuthContext).
    ◦ If the user is authenticated, render the child routes using Outlet from react-router-dom.
    ◦ If the user is not authenticated, redirect them to the /login page using Navigate from react-router-dom.
5. Application Routing (index.jsx in routes folder):
    ◦ Define your application's routes using createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom.
    ◦ Organise routes into public, authenticated-only (wrapped by ProtectedRoute), and non-authenticated-only routes, ensuring correct conditional rendering based on the token status from useAuth.
6. Logout Functionality:
    ◦ Implement a Logout component that calls the clearToken function from AuthContext to clear the token and redirect the user back to a public route (e.g., home or login page).
Code Structure and Best Practices:
• Organise code into logical folders such as src/pages, src/provider, src/routes, src/components, and potentially src/hooks.
• Ensure components are clean, maintainable, and reusable where appropriate.
• Follow standard React naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase for components).
• Prioritise functional components and hooks.
Please provide the code snippets for each part, starting with the project setup and moving incrementally through the authentication flow."
