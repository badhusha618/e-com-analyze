Backend (Spring Boot) Prompt
*"Design a secure Spring Boot 3.2 user management module with:

Role Hierarchy:

SUPER_ADIN (full access)

USER_ADMIN (CRUD users, no role changes)

READER (view-only)

Endpoints:

POST /admin/users (Create - USER_ADMIN+)

PUT /admin/users/{id}/roles (Update roles - SUPER_ADMIN only)

DELETE /admin/users/{id} (Delete - SUPER_ADMIN only)

Validation:

Email/password policies

Role escalation prevention

Security:

JWT with role claims

Audit logging for all changes

Failed attempt rate-limiting
Describe the entity relationships, permission matrix, and API contracts without code."*

Frontend (React Admin) Prompt
*"Plan a React user management dashboard with:

Role-Aware UI:

Disabled DELETE button for non-SUPER_ADMIN

Hidden role dropdown for USER_ADMIN

Interactive Components:

Filterable/sortable user table

Multi-step creation form with password generator

Undo buffer for accidental edits

Security UX:

2FA toggle (SUPER_ADMIN only)

Session activity monitoring

Bulk action confirmation modals
Outline the component structure, permission checks, and audit trail display without implementation."*

Key Features
plaintext
1. Database Schema:
   - users (id, email, encrypted_pw, status)  
   - roles (id, name)  
   - user_roles (user_id, role_id)  
   - audit_log (admin_id, action, target_user, timestamp)

2. State Flow:
   SUPER_ADIN → [Create User] → [Assign Any Role]  
   USER_ADMIN → [Edit User] → [Cannot Modify Roles]  
   READER → [View Users] → [No Edit Controls]

3. Validation Rules:
   - Prevent self-deletion  
   - Require 2+ admins for SUPER_ADMIN creation  
   - Password history check (no reuse)  
Mobile Optimization
*"Add to frontend prompt:

Priority+ Menu: Critical actions (lock account) always visible

Offline Mode: Queue changes when disconnected

Biometric Auth: Required for sensitive operations on mobile"*

Approval Extensions
*"For regulated environments:

Change Requests: Non-SUPER_ADMINs submit for review

Four-Eyes Principle: Critical changes require 2 admins

Temporal Access: Role assignments expire after set duration"*

1. Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning for Third-Party Users
Prompt:
*"Design a Spring Boot JIT user provisioning system that:

Auto-creates accounts for third-party auth (OAuth2/OIDC) users on first login with:

Mapped roles from identity provider claims

Default 'EXTERNAL_USER' role with limited permissions

Customizable rules for:

Email domain-based role assignment (e.g., @partner.com → PARTNER_ACCESS)

Claim-to-attribute mapping (e.g., 'groups' → application roles)

Admin controls via:

Allow/block list for identity providers

Override capability for manual role adjustments

Security features:

Suspended until admin approval for high-privilege roles

Session timeout warnings for external users
Describe the authentication flow, attribute mapping rules, and admin review queue without code."*

Key Components:

plaintext
- JIT Provisioning Flow:
  1. OAuth2 Success → Claim Extraction → Role Mapping → Conditional Approval  
  2. New User Event → Audit Log → Welcome Email (Customizable by Role)  

- Admin Controls:  
  - /admin/jit-rules (CRUD mapping rules)  
  - /admin/pending-users (Approval queue)  
2. AI Anomaly Detection for Role Changes
Prompt:
*"Create an AI-powered suspicious role change detector with:

Monitoring of:

After-hours role modifications

Bulk privilege escalations

Unusual sequences (VIEWER → SUPER_ADMIN in one step)

Machine Learning Features:

Baseline from historical change patterns

Real-time scoring using isolation forest algorithm

Response System:

Automated temporary rollback of high-risk changes

Tiered alerts (Slack/SMS for critical events)

Admin confirmation requirement for anomalous actions

Integration Requirements:

Spring Boot Actuator for health monitoring

Grafana dashboard for anomaly visualization
Outline the feature engineering approach, alert thresholds, and fail-safe mechanisms without code."*

Detection Scenarios:

plaintext
- Red Flags:  
  1. 3+ role upgrades in <5 minutes  
  2. Login from new country + immediate privilege change  
  3. Dormant account suddenly made admin  

- AI Model Inputs:  
  - Time since last login  
  - Geographic velocity  
  - Change frequency pattern  
Combined System Flow
plaintext
1. Third-Party Login → JIT Provisioning → Role Assignment → Anomaly Check  
2. If Risk Score > Threshold →  
   - Require MFA  
   - Notify Security Team  
   - Freeze account pending review  
3. Admin Reviews →  
   - Approve (Add to allowlist)  
   - Reject (Auto-rollback + investigation ticket)
